Welcome to Open Legal Data Platform's documentation!
====================================================

OLDP is a web application, written in Python 3.5 and based on the Django web framework,
It is used for processing legal text and providing a REST-API and Elasticsearch-based search engine.
OLDP is being develop by the non-profit initiative Open Legal Data with the goal
of building an Open Data platform for legal documents (mainly court decisions and laws).
The platform makes legal information freely accessible for the general public and especially third-party apps.
